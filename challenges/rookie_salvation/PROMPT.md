```
Rook’s last stand against NEMEGHAST begins now. This is no longer a simulation—it’s the collapse of control. Legend speaks of only one entity who ever broke free from the Matrix: the original architect of NEMEGHAST. His name—buried, forbidden, encrypted—was the master key. If you can recover it… and inject it into the core... Rook will finally be free.
```
