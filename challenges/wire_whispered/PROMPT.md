```
Brynn’s night-threads flared as connections vanished and reappeared in reverse, each route bending back like a reflection misremembered. The capture showed silent gaps between fevered bursts—packets echoing out of sequence, jittering like whispers behind glass. Eira and Cordelia now sift the capture, tracing the pattern’s cadence to learn whether it’s mere corruption… or the Hollow King learning to speak through the wire. Note: Make sure you are using Wireshark v4.6.0+ Note2: Use PyRDP *git* version

Answer the answer to each of these questions is a flag.

1. What is the username affected by the spray?
2. What is the password for that username
3. What is the website the victim is currently browsing. (TLD only: google.com)
4. What is the username:password combination for website `http://barrowick.htb`
```
