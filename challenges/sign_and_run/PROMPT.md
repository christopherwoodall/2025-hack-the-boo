```
At the edge of Hollow Mere stands an ancient automaton known as the Iron Scribe - a machine that writes commands in living metal and executes only those sealed with a valid mark. The Scribe's master key was lost ages ago, but its forges still hum, stamping glyphs of permission into every order it receives. Willem approaches the machine's console, where it offers a bargain: "Sign your words, and I shall act. Present a forged seal, and be undone." To awaken the Scribe's obedience, one must understand how its mark is made... and how to make it lie.
```
