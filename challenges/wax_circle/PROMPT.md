```
Atop the standing stones of Black Fen, Elin lights her last tallow lantern. The mists recoil, revealing a network of unseen sigils carved beneath the fen’s grass—her sister’s old routes, long hidden. But the lantern flickers, showing Elin a breach line moving toward the heartstone. Her final task is not to seal a door, but to rewrite the threshold. Drawing from years of etched chalk and mirror-ink, she weaves a new lattice of bindings across the stone. As the Hollow King approaches, she turns the boundary web inward—trapping him in a net of his own forgotten paths.
