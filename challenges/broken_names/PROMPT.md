```
Among the ruins of Briarfold, Mira uncovers a gate of tangled brambles and forgotten sigils. Every name carved into its stone has been reversed, letters twisted, meanings erased. When she steps through, the ground blurs—the village ahead is hers, yet wrong: signs rewritten, faces familiar but altered, her own past twisted. Tracing the pattern through spectral threads of lies and illusion, she forces the true gate open—not by key, but by unraveling the false paths the Hollow King left behind.
```
